Modlist Manager
=
Purpose
-
Have you ever tried to update your custom modpack to different Minecraft version, only to end up losing interest for
playing Minecraft and playing something else? This can be a very annoying task; opening each mod download page, sorting
through it, downloading the correct version and moving it to your mods folder. I have dealt with this many of times, to
the point that I created this project!

It is a simple application which provides an interface to create and store your custom 'modlists' and seamlessly check
compatibility or download the modlist for a specific Minecraft version and mod loader of your choosing. This also many
quality-of-life features/tools including sorting, finding, selecting and deleting which aim to decrease your time
managing your modlists and instead increasing your time enjoying minecraft!

Installation
-
1. Download the project code as a .zip and extract the .zip anywhere you'd like to!

Notes
-
When saving, the modlists are stored in .txt files within the 'modlists' folder. If you remove/update the project files,
make sure to keep a backup of those .txt files, otherwise your modlists will be lost to the eternal pit of being 
overridden.

Future Content
-
As of right now, I'm not actively expanding the projects features. However, if you have a suggestion, feel free to post
it in this github repository. I will do my best to respond and implement your ideas. If you find a bug, let me know and
I will fix these as soon as possible! Thanks.

As Python's Base Tkinter Styling is horrible and it would be a hassle to create an appealing CustomtKinter, the
alternative was to use external Tkinter style packages. This project uses 
[Sun Valley](https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme) by [rebende](https://github.com/rdbende), a massive
glow up without the effort (like plastic surgery).
